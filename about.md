A blog about development of Zshell projects. In **2016**, I did **3152**
commits in total. That is **8.7** commits a day. In **2017**, it was **2737**
commits, it is **7.5** commits a day. Not excluding holidays. Check my Github
profile to obtain confirmation for those numbers:
[https://github.com/psprint](https://github.com/psprint). All code was for
Zshell or indirectly associated with Zshell. 

Please support me, I need money for coffee and for various services like
NameCheap email, domain or BlinkenShell account, etc. You can joing Patreon
at [https://www.patreon.com/psprint](https://www.patreon.com/psprint) or
donate through [PayPal button](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=D54B3S7C6HGME).
I have more ideas for projects and features, I hope I maintain the **~8**
commits a day pace thanks to the donations.

Thanks for reading!
