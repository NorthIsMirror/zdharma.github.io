Main project is currently ZUI – Zsh User Interface library, that allows to create applications with curses interface in a manner resembling CGI+(D)HTML. It recalls the old term “RAD” – rapid application development. Here is what is sufficient to create hello world application: demo_mod1_generator() { local mod=\"$1\" ice=\"$2\" # Content, no hyper-links reply=( \"Hello World from ${ZUI[YELLOW]}ZUI${ZUI[COLOR_END]}! Module $mod, instance $ice.\" ) # Non-selectable lines Hops to jump with [ and ] Local anchors reply2=( ) reply3=( 1 ) reply4=( ) } Check out full Hello World example code. Other featured project is Zconvey. It allows to send commands between Zsh sessions. Its main use case is to switch your workflow to new project with: cd ~/github/project2 zc-all cd $PWD Check out Zconvey’s home page and Asciinema video there.","meta":{"draft":false,"categories":["overview"],"layout":"post","title":"Zdharma Initiative starting up","date":"2017-03-12 11:29:00 +0100","type":"post","tags":["zdharma"],"slug":"Zdharma-Initiative-starting-up","ext":".markdown","excerpt":"<p>I’ve created zdharma.org and multiple Zsh projects because the Zsh language is enough powerfull\nto support sophisticated and large tasks.

Who knows what else will get possible. Currently implemented: buttons, anchors, list-boxes, text-fields, toggle buttons, timeout callback, state serialization, (D)HTML-like architecture. Check out demo on text-fields and list-boxes. The timeout callback is basically a timer that calls your function every N milliseconds – a configure/make wrapper has been written that way. There are endless possibilities with ZUI.","meta":{"draft":false,"categories":["zui"],"layout":"post","title":"ZUI release is near","date":"2017-03-17 20:52:00 +0100","type":"post","tags":["projects","zui"],"slug":"ZUI-release-is-near","ext":".markdown","excerpt":"<p>I’ve implemented almost every needed feature.
